# 02. How to estimate whether a code will exceed the time limit(TLE)? 
## Intro

This is the second most frequent reason for our code to fail. We need to establish a systematically way to estimate the code running time.

Question:
- What will be the factors affecting the running time of the code?
- How to estimate the Time Complexity of the code?
- How is the testing time related to number of cases tested?

The related topic following up will be:
- **How can we improve the running time (efficiency) of the code?**  
- **How can we prove that our code has achieved the best performance among all possible way to solve the problem?**

These two questions can be the two new article topics.
