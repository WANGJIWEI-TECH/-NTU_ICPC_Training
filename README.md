### Welcome to the NTU_ICPC_Training! Our team will use this repo to track the competitive programming training progress for ICPC and write the solutions and reflections. Glad to share :)

ðŸ“’ To save time, please kindly refer to the questions website to read the questions. Only the solutions and discussion will be presented in this repo.

In the reflections, we want to record what we did well and the area to improve. For example:
- How can we prevent the wrong test case? 
- How can we estimate the Time Limit Exceed (TLE)?
